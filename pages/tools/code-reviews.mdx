Code Reviews exist to improve the software development lifecycle, your coworker can catch bugs, improvements, best practices. It's a long term win win for everyone involved.


Code Reviews exist to improve the software development lifecycle, your coworker can catch bugs, improvements, best practices. It's a long term win win for everyone involved.
But, they're a whole lot more than just pointing out flaws! They're a bonding and learning activity for you and your teammates.


### Before review

Settle style arguments with a style guide, use an existing one or build one incrementally



## When Submitting Code
Keep your chunk of code you're sending up as small as possible. Keep it between 10 and 300 lines of code.
Leave a good description to give context for the reviewer
Address unrelated code within the pull request
Keep your commits well organised

### KISS
Keep It Small and Simple
200-300 lines
Lowest possible barrier to start review
Higher quality of reviews
Less blind spots (more care and understanding can go into your code)



### Who to pick to review your code
Do they have the right context?
Do they have the skills related to this?
Do they care deeply about this?
Are they learning about this?



> Our code not my code

## When Recieving Feedback
Do not take feedback personally
Ignoring comments is bad manners
Respond to comments in depth if you disagree
Hop on a call to sync with the person who reviewed your code so you can clear up understanding

## When Reviewing Code
Have a clear understanding of what you are reviewing and why. Remember that criticism is difficult for everyone to receive so be understanding and kind.
Ensure code meets standards - list what those standards are, and follow them
Find bugs,
Share knowledge
Check the code is understandable
Ensure the code does what it is supposed to do
Clean up tech debt
Leave comments and overcommunicate when possible, be really clear on how strongly you feel towards potential changes you're suggesting
Don't be afraid to ask for clarity and give your understanding of things to discuss with them later
Write code examples to exaplin what you think would be a better solution. "Consider using this technique...(show example)"
Don't say the word "you"
"you mispelled this"... that can be taken as a non objective discussion
It's about the code not the coder
Replace you with "we"

Don't be bossy, be collaborative with your language
Offer actionable feedback, provide links to documentation where possible
Always assume best intention
The phrasing should be opening up for discussion rather than commanding

Offer sincere praise
Recognise when they show improvement
Include positive feedback


Having opinions on code is an occupational requirement

## Anti-Patterns
Nit-Picking is not helpful, formatting should be automated for example
Ghost-reviewer - not giving feedback at all is incredibly unhelpful
PingPong reviews - don't come back with more changes after first feedback, outline all necessary changes then and there

## When to review
During implementation?
When it's ready to merge?
After it's been merged

When is the review complete?
when everyone agrees?
when a gatekeeper agrees?
when all comments are addressed?

## To Approve or Not to Approve
Know the standards your team ahears to
A rejected review can really upset team members, so if there's a problem, be ready to discuss why, have good communication with your team. 
Direct communication is best
Prioritise reviews - is this blocking code?
