### How and why you should be learning every day
​
##your daily routine

Learning should be a thing you do daily. I’m saying this because I’ve realised I tend to learn the bare minimum for everything.
Then my skill level stagnates. My work imporves only by trial and error.
If
 you just learn cooking like that…never know, maybe there’s better ways 
of using the knife, maybe you dont understand some fundamentals, maybe 
the knowledge of food paring is needed.
Or cleaning even, maybe you do that in a way that could be vastly 
improved.
For everything you do in life, strive to do it well.
I realised I have this part of my brain that doesn’t care to be the best at something, mediocre is fine to it.
We gotta fight that part of the brain
So, how? well firstly pros of any given field are on youtube and blogging about how they got where they are. Let’s go there
Literally Googling “Learn (Blender) Roadmap, everything I need is there.
  we live in a time right now where you can hear the experts opinion in seconds
  thanks to Youtube. The best teachers in the world are there, go find them, go
  listen to them. Don't waste this valuable resource. Remember, you don't know
  shit. yet.


Keep at the top of your roadmap the thing you need to create, it’s he reason we are even putting effort in at all.
roadmaps for all the skills I want to obtain
daily schedule of learning

First do it, then do it right, then do it better

​

Success Formula
Show up. Most people don’t show up.
Play. Stay curious. Trade your cleverness for bewilderment

Information + Emotion = Long Term Memory
Deliver results
It is easy to be fooled into thinking being busy equates to results. What actually matters are the 
outcomes of our work

Elon's 2 rules for learning anything faster
“I think it’s important to view knowledge as sort of semantic tree. Make 
sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e., the trunk and big 
branches, before you get into the leaves/details, or there is nothing 
for them to hang on to.” - Elon Musk, on Reddit

Make sure you’re building a tree of knowledge

understand how and why something works the way it does

Connections power your learning

you can’t remember what you can’t connect
connect your learning to your base knowledge

​
How to solve the problem?
Can you solve this for me?
A : it depends, please give me more information
“imagine” the steps of solving the problem in your head
break it down in to logical small steps
The smaller and easier the tasks the smoother the project goes

write that into code

there are no clear set rules of how something should be done
there are tools and frameworks to help you make a contextually good choice

​
How to learn programming
think of something you want to build and begin building it

Personally, I have a handheld notebook that I keep beside my computer. Each day I write tasks I want to complete today.
I’ve tried online things, tried to keep a calendar in Notion but for some reason handwritten notes just do it for me.
It’s a nice notebook too, not random pieces of paper.
It allows me to easily see progress of amount of tasks I can get done in a day, also easy to plan for tomorrow.
​
Many people don't succeed in learning programming
This is true for a few reasons
people end up in tutorial hell
I
 thought it was b$ until I could follow a tutorial and make a cool 
marketplace…but when asked to write a function without help? I’d want to
 cry. That’s what is meant by tutorial hell, you’re stuck watching 
tutorials like they’re life support.
my theory is that it’s 
because you’re blindly following yet not actually understanding -why- 
that thing was put there, -why- this was done and not -that-


> It’s very important to understand why you’re doing things and you learn by doing, absolutely…but you remember things by understanding how they work and why they work the way they work. - [metalandcoffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KcglsWpyko)

how can we avoid this?
don’t get discouraged
learn to type without copying everything from tutorials

Make sure you understand what you’re learning with challenges:

- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/)





Be okay with having a hard time
it’s going to be difficult, don’t let it get you down
the worst thing you can do is just sit there and stress
embrace the struggle

Got
 a subject you need to learn? watch 3 different youtube channels. Watch 
once, watch the next ones on double speed on confirm and contrast 
information
Helps to hear same information repeated in different ways
​
How to Google
put your search inside ” ” for exact matches
only from a particular site? site:fireship.io react hooks
site:url search term

exclude some results?
same as above followed by minus that term →. -jquery

certain date
after:2020


​
How to plan projects
The steps to take to start solving problems…
identify
identify and understand the nature of the problem
make a problem statement
Context
we must merge 600 pull requests
issue
it would take days to click the button manually
why do i care?
it will save us millions of dollars


research and refine
google it, research what others have done to solve the same problem
you’re likely not the first one
make sure you confidently understand what the code does before using it

discuss issue with other devs
can this api help me?
you should have by this point broken the main problem into lots of smaller problems

pseudocode
write outline for how e will implement code
focus on logic, not syntax
name things as exactly the problem they solve


test-driven development
//Jest
understand what tests wil be valuable for that feature

implement
Done is better than perfect

reflect
reflect on the code


​
Starting projects
Starting
 from templates can go really bad, you dont have an understanding of how
 the whole thing works. use templates as your guide for sticking new 
things into your own app.
​
How to improve your code
improve readability by naming things better
add comments
remove duplication
optimise time/space complexity of algorithms
add error handling
