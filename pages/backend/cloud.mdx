*pay monthly fee, get access to a data center's servers*

You wouldn't call someone 'car-less' if they didn't own a car and instead regularly used uber, Serverless is exactly the same. You don't own a server but you can pay someone who does own one to execute your code when you need it.

### Multi-Tier Architecture

-   **Presentation **- The visual layout of the data (GUI)

-   **Application **- The processing/business logic, how we're mainpulating the data

-   **Data **- getting and storing the data

Multi-tier is a very common approach traditionally used in the past moreso **servers would've been needed for each layer**

### **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**

A cloud service model. Server-side **logic **and **state **are hosted by a cloud provider, a series of APIs in the cloud

### **Function as a Service (FaaS)**

-   **Event Triggered Code **- Run on containers

-   **Dynamic **- If traffic spike, more instances of your app will be spun up

-   **Ephemeral **- lasting only a short time. Once their work is complete the containers are gone

Serverless Architecture
-----------------------

A runtime architecture where you've written small pieces of code that is executed through a cloud provider.

-   APPLICATION

-   FaaS

-   BaaS

-   Cloud Provider

-   Physical Infrastructure
