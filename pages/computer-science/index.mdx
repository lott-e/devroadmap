  {
    id: 1,
    frontHTML: <div>What is pseudo-code?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        Pseudo-code is a way of writing out code in plain English or a simplified language, rather than using a specific programming language's syntax. It is often used as a planning or communication tool to outline the logic and steps of a program before implementing it in a particular programming language.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    frontHTML: <div>What is the difference between frontend and backend development?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        Frontend development focuses on the user interface and everything the end user will interact with. It involves working with markup languages like HTML, styling with CSS, and adding interactive functionality with JavaScript. Backend development, on the other hand, involves working on the server-side of web applications. It includes handling the business logic, data storage, processing requests, and integrating various components to make the application work.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    frontHTML: <div>What is an API?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods, data formats, and authentication mechanisms for requests and responses between frontend and backend systems, even if they are written in different programming languages.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    frontHTML: <div>What is the purpose of a cookie in web development?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's browser by a website. They are used to store information about the user's session, preferences, and other data that helps the server identify and track the user's interactions. For example, cookies can be used to remember a user's login status, language preference, or items in a shopping cart.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    frontHTML: <div>What is the role of a DNS (Domain Name System) in web development?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        DNS translates domain names into IP addresses. When a user types in a URL, the DNS server is responsible for finding the IP address associated with that domain name and directing the request to the appropriate server. It acts like a phone book of the internet, mapping human-readable domain names to computer-readable IP addresses.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    frontHTML: <div>What is a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        A DDoS attack is an attempt by an attacker to overwhelm a website or server with a flood of traffic, making it inaccessible to legitimate users. The attacker typically uses a botnet, a network of compromised computers, to generate a high volume of requests that overload the target server, causing a denial of service to legitimate users.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    frontHTML: <div>What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network) and how does it work?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        A CDN is a network of distributed servers located around the world that work together to deliver web content to users more efficiently. When a user requests content, the CDN serves the content from a server located in their geographic region, reducing the distance and improving the delivery speed. This helps to minimize latency and improve the overall performance of websites and applications, especially for users located far from the original server.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    frontHTML: <div>What is serverless computing?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        Serverless computing refers to a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the underlying infrastructure and automatically provisions, scales, and manages the execution of the application code. Developers can focus on writing and deploying code without the need to manage servers or infrastructure. Examples of serverless platforms include AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.
