questionsContent={[
  {
    id: 1,
    frontHTML: <div>What is a unit test?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        A unit test is a type of test that focuses on testing the smallest testable parts of an application, typically individual functions or methods. It aims to verify that each unit of code behaves as expected in isolation.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    frontHTML: <div>What is an integration test?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        An integration test is a type of test that verifies the interaction between different components or modules of an application. It checks if the integrated components work together correctly and produce the expected results.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    frontHTML: <div>What is an end-to-end test?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        An end-to-end test is a type of test that simulates real user scenarios and tests the entire application from start to finish. It checks if all the components, modules, and dependencies work together as expected and deliver the desired functionality.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    frontHTML: <div>What is the difference between branch coverage and coverage metrics?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        Branch coverage is a type of code coverage metric that measures the percentage of branches in the code that are executed during testing. Coverage metrics, on the other hand, provide an overall measure of how much of the code is covered by tests, including lines, functions, and branches.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    frontHTML: <div>How often should our tests be executed?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        Tests should ideally be executed regularly and as part of the development process. This can include running tests during the build process, before deploying to production, or as part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The frequency depends on the project's needs and the testing strategy.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    frontHTML: <div>What are the two schools of testing, mockist/London and classical/Detroit?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        The mockist/London and classical/Detroit are two different approaches or schools of thought in testing. The mockist/London school emphasizes the use of mocks and focuses on testing individual units in isolation. The classical/Detroit school, on the other hand, focuses on testing the behavior of the entire system and places less emphasis on using mocks.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    frontHTML: <div>Tell me about test doubles and mocks?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        Test doubles are objects or components used in place of real dependencies during testing. Mocks are a type of test double that allows specifying and controlling the behavior of the mocked dependency. They are used to simulate certain behaviors or responses that the real dependency would provide during testing.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    frontHTML: <div>What does AAA stand for?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        AAA stands for Arrange, Act, Assert. It is a common pattern used in unit testing. The pattern suggests that the test should be divided into three sections: arranging the necessary preconditions or test setup, acting on the unit under test by invoking a method or performing an operation, and finally asserting that the expected outcomes or behavior are observed.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    frontHTML: <div>What do static analysis tools help us achieve?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        Static analysis tools help us achieve code quality and detect potential issues or bugs in our codebase without executing the code. They analyze the source code or compiled code and provide insights into code complexity, potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, coding style violations, and more. They assist in maintaining code standards, improving code maintainability, and reducing the chance of introducing bugs.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    frontHTML: <div>What is XState?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        XState is a JavaScript and TypeScript library for managing application state and behavior using finite state machines. It provides a declarative way to define states, transitions, and actions, making it easier to understand, visualize, and reason about complex application logic.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    frontHTML: <div>Why would we use XState?</div>,
    backHTML: (
      <>
        XState helps in managing complex application state and behavior by providing a formal and structured approach using finite state machines. It promotes modularity, testability, and code clarity. It can be used in various scenarios, such as user interface interactions, workflow management, game development, and more, where managing state and transitions become crucial.
